        <p>Hello, I am Vic, full nickname Vicstand0891.</p>
        <p>I am an amateur Independent game developer, musical producer and composer, video editor, graphic designer, writer, digital painter and programmer</p>
        <p>I aspire to create and share my ideas through the web, to communicate simple yet entertaining stories, to create casual activites for the user to interact with and try to be innovative and creative while doing so...</p>
        <p>... It seems there's not much else to do in here... Maybe come back in the future.</p>
